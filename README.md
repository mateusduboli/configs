configs
=======

Here i handle my configuration files, especially my vim configs and bash aliases.

Setup
=====
The setup script creates the symbolic links from the repository base directory
to the user's home. If there was already files in the directory, it sends then
to the `backup` directory.

It also installs `vundle` via github, and performs a `BundleInstall` afterwards.

Vim plugins
===========
Currently I'm using this plugins:
  * Conque-Shell
  * fugitive.vim
  * surround.vim
  * Syntastic
  * Tagbar
  * The-NERD-Tree
  * vim-airline
  * vundle
  * wombat256.vim
